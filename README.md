Shopping Cart: Users can add products to the shopping cart, view the cart's contents, and remove items as needed.
Checkout System: A simple checkout page where users can review their order, enter shipping details, and simulate payment (no real payment gateway integration).
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile devices and desktops.
Product Detail Pages: Clicking on a product leads to a detailed page showing the productâ€™s description, images, price, and reviews.

Technologies Used:
